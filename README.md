This project is on Wearable technology company that produces smart watches emits different signals,
which include variations in green, red and infrared light. One of the key features is that its ability
to detect and alert users to potential drowsiness based on the physiological data.

ÔÅµ Objective : To perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset collected from these
smartwatches. The dataset includes various physiological parameters along with a 'drowsiness'
label, which indicates the level of sleepiness based on an adapted Karolinska Sleepiness Scale
(KSS).
